1. Clean Code Definition
- should be readable and meaningful
- should reduce cognitive load
- should be concise and "to the point"
- should avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks
- should follow common best practices and patterns
- should be fun to write and to maintain

1.1. Focus on "naming" things
- names should be meaningful
- name casing {
    snake_case e.g. Python -> Variables, functions, methods
    camelCase e.g. Java, JavaScript -> Variables, functions, methods
    PascalCase e.g. Python, Java, JavaScript ->  Classes
    kebab-case e.g. HTML -> Custom HTML Elements
}

1.2. Code Structure, Comments and Formatting
